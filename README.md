Athlinix

Athlinix is a sports journey documentation and analysis app designed for athletes and coaches. It provides tools to track games, analyze performance, manage teams, and share achievements â€” all in one place. Athlinix bridges the gap for athletes who lack accessible tools to organize their sports data and gain insights into their growth.
